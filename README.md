# ModellingPatientHistories

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master’s thesis project on modeling longitudinal patient histories from MIMIC-IV using discrete-time Markov chains. 

## Project status
Work in progress.
- Data extraction and consolidation (PostgreSQL views/materialized views)

## Repository structure
- `data/` – local data from MIMIC and preprocessed data (ignored by git)
- `doc/` – documentation files and pdf of the thesis
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks (EDA, prototyping, validation)
- `outputs/` – local results/models/exports (ignored by git)
- `src/` – Python source code (database access, feature engineering, modeling)
- `sql/` – SQL scripts to run extraction/pipelines

## Requirements
- macOS or Linux
- Python (via Conda recommended)
- PostgreSQL (local instance)
- Access to MIMIC-IV via PhysioNet (data is not included in this repository)
